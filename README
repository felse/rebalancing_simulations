this is the readme file to create your own rebalancing simulations.
this repository contains two subdirectories:

1) simulations
create simulations, requires the xtreemfs colocation client package to provide the rebalancing algorithms.
it is available at https://github.com/felse/xtreemfs_colocation_client 

2) R_analysis
create statistics from the simulation results and print plots as pdf files.
if there is exactly one simulation, it will print detailed results of the one simulations; it is not recommended to use a lot of folders (>> 100) or servers (>> 10).
if there is more than one simulation, average statstics will be displayed.

the following steps should reproduce the results of the paper:
N  ) install software (python + xtreemfs_colocation_client, R with the required packages)
i  ) execute simulations/minimal_split_sizes.sh
ii ) copy the generated file to R_analysis/
iii) execute R_analysis/r_makespans.R and R_analysis/r_total_size_moved.sh
iv ) the plots should then be located in R_analysis/pdfs/ 

in order to run simulations with your own parameters, you may edit the following files:
- simulations/minimal_split_sizes.sh is the script you want to edit for most purposes. you can also use it to look up the command line syntax for simulations/Simulator.py. if you use this script, make sure to first generate input files using simulations/InputGenerator.py. 
- simulations/InputGenerator.py yields some basic options to modify the set of folders used for the simulations
- simulations/Simulator.py runs the simulations. some options can only be set by modifying the source code.

note that changing the simulation parameters will likely change the simulation result output file name. so make sure to also adapt the R scripts accordingly if you want to create statistics/plots with them.
